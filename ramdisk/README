we have these folders in this repo:

prebuild:
	to store header files and libraries for cross compling.

tools:
	bin and scritps for generating rootfs

configs:
	we have two types of configuration file:
	1. txt: for file list in ramdisk
	2. its: for generating itb file

target:
	file to build up a root filesystem. there are two subfolders:
	1. common: for platform independent files
	2. overlay: for platform dependent files
	when building rootfs, files in overlay folder will be merged
	into common folder.

in configs folder and target/overlay folder, there are subfolders for
priority purpose: if a folder with project's name exists, it would be
merged into a folder with its chip name. project folder has higher
priority.

for example, if we are building bm1682_asic_box project,
configs/bm1682_asic_box and config/bm1682 would be merged to generate
build/bm1682_asic_box/configs. target/overlay/bm1682_asic_box,
target/overlay/bm1682 and target/common would be merget to generate
build/bm1682_asic_box/target.
