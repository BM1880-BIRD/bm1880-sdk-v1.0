BITMAIN Hardware spinlock device Binding
-----------------------------------------------

Required properties :
- compatible : shall contain only one of the following:
	"sirf,hwspinlock"

- reg : the register address of hwspinlock

- #hwlock-cells : hwlock users only use the hwlock id to represent a specific
	hwlock, so the number of cells should be <1> here.

Please look at the generic hwlock binding for usage information for consumers,
"Documentation/devicetree/bindings/hwlock/hwlock.txt"

Example of hwlock provider:
	hwspinlock: spinlock {
		compatible = "bitmain,hwspinlock";
		spinlock_numbers = <4>;
	};

Example of hwlock users:
	node {
		...
		hwlocks = <&hwlock 2>;
		...
	};
