Bitmain Synchronous Serial Interface.

Required properties:
- compatible : "snps,dw-apb-ssi"
- reg : The register base for the controller.
- interrupts : One interrupt, used by the controller.
- #address-cells : <1>, as required by generic SPI binding.
- #size-cells : <0>, also as required by generic SPI binding.

Optional properties:
- cs-gpios : Specifies the gpio pis to be used for chipselects.
- num-cs : The number of chipselects. If omitted, this will default to 4.

Child nodes as per the generic SPI binding.

Required properties:
- compatible : "rohm,dh2228fv"
- reg : The register base for the controller.
- spi-max-frequency: The maximum frequency of spi

Example:

	spi0:spi0@50030000 {
		compatible = "snps,dw-apb-ssi";
		reg = <0x0 0x50030000 0x0 0x1000>;
		interrupts = <GIC_SPI 65 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
		clocks = <&pclk>;
		clock-frequency = <25000000>;
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <0>;
		num-cs = <1>;
		switch-gpios = <&port0a 7 0>;

		spidev: spidev@0 {
			compatible = "rohm,dh2228fv";
			spi-max-frequency = <25000000>;
			reg = <0>;
		};
	};


Add pinmux to activate spi0
Example:

	spi0-mux{
		compatible = "bitmain,spi0-mux";
		pinctrl-names= "acquire", "release";
		pinctrl-0= <&spi0_acquire>;
		pinctrl-1= <&spi0_release>;
	};
