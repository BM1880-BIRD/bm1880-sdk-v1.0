TODO:
	- checkpatch.pl cleanups
	- sparse fixes
	- rename files to be not so "generic"
	- add proper arch dependencies as needed
	- audit userspace interfaces to make sure they are sane


ion/
 - Add dt-bindings for remaining heaps (chunk and carveout heaps). This would
   involve putting appropriate bindings in a memory node for Ion to find.
 - Split /dev/ion up into multiple nodes (e.g. /dev/ion/heap0)
 - Better test framework (integration with VGEM was suggested)

sync framework:
 - remove CONFIG_SW_SYNC_USER, it is used only for testing/debugging and
 should not be upstreamed.
 - port CONFIG_SW_SYNC_USER tests interfaces to use debugfs somehow
 - port libsync tests to kselftest
 - clean up and ABI check for security issues
 - move it to drivers/base/dma-buf
